# Welcome
Hello all. Welcome to this repo, Here I made an example bot using Python & the PyCord libs

# Why did you make this repo?
I made this repo for a few reasons. 
- One, so people can use slash commands instead of using the prefix
- Two, I was bored lmao
- Three, to help people out.

# oMg YoUr NoT uSiNg "discord.py" wHy ArEn'T yOu UsInG iT !!!1!??
Calm down calm down, Im not using it because when I tried to use slash commands before moving to PyCord it kept giving me errors. So when I found out PyCord was more modern, I switched to that and it has been working well.

# How do I install PyCord Drxy?
A link to install is available here: https://guide.pycord.dev/installation this will also help you make a bot as well. **Make sure to uninstall *"discord.py"* first!!**

# How can we reach you Drxy?
My discord is: **defnot.drxy**
